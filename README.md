🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Report - A Power BI Dashboard 📊

Excited to share my latest project where I developed an interactive Air Quality Report using Power BI. This dashboard provides key insights into air quality trends across various cities, helping analyze pollution levels in a visually impactful manner.

Key Highlights:
✅ Top 3 Polluted Cities: Ahmedabad, Delhi, and Patna showing critical AQI levels.
✅ Bottom 3 Polluted Cities: Coimbatore, Shillong, and Aizawl recorded the best air quality.
✅ Area-Wise AQI Overview: Interactive map to visualize air quality across regions.
✅ AQI Trend Analysis: Historical trends show improvement from 2015 to 2020.
✅ NO, CO, PM2.5, and SO2 Averages: Real-time indicators for pollutants that impact health.

Tools Used:
🔹 Power BI for Data Visualization
🔹 DAX for advanced calculations
🔹 Map and trend charts for regional & time-based analysis

This project aims to raise awareness about air quality challenges while providing actionable insights through clean and dynamic visualizations. 🌱
